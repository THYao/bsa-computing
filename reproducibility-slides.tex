	\section{Introduction}

	\begin{frame}{Why do I care about reproducibility?}
		Reproducible research is a hallmark of the scientific method, but we're pretty bad at it. 
		
		\begin{quote}
			In 2012, a researcher then at the biotechnology company Amgen wrote in Nature that when his team tried to reproduce 53 landmark cancer studies, they could replicate just six. And according to a news report in Nature, a project aiming to reproduce the findings of 100 psychology papers has managed to replicate results for only 39 of them (the project's findings are still under peer review).

	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{But I'm a Biostatistician!}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reproducibility is important in both science AND statistics!
			\item As statisticians, we need to be able to reproduce our results on the same data set
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This means we have to write reports in a way that minimizes error and write code so that we can get the same results years later.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Agenda}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \texttt{Git}: A ``version control'' tool used for collaborating and maintaining different versions of a file, typically for code.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Great for collaborating, or just saving your own ass.
				\item Often used in conjunction with \textit{GitHub}, an online repository storage service.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \texttt{knitr}: An R package that lets you create documents containing R code and output.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Keep everything you need to generate a report (e.g., for research, homework, or 699) in one place!
				\item My favorite part: Update code without having to re-create tables! (This is where errors creep in!)
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{frame}

	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Setup}
		Create a GitHub account, then download either Git or GitHub Desktop.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Pure Git (i.e., just command-line tools): \url{https://git-scm.com/downloads}
			\item GitHub Desktop (GUI \& command-line tools): \url{https://desktop.github.com/}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Forking a Repository}
		A \textit{fork} is a copy of a repository. Forks let you
		\begin{itemize}
			\item make changes to an existing repo without affecting the original project
			\item use the existing project as a starting point for your own
		\end{itemize}
		One of the benefits of open source!
		
		\textbf{Exercise:} Fork my \texttt{bsa-computing} repository.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Cloning a Repository}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item To create a local copy of an existing git repository, use 
			\\ \texttt{git clone [url] [directory-name]}.
			\item In a terminal (Mac, Linux) or the Git Shell (Windows), navigate to the folder you want to clone the repository into.
			\item \textbf{Exercise:} Clone your forked \texttt{bsa-computing} repository onto your computer. The URL will be of the form \texttt{https://github.com/[username]/bsa-computing.git}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Make Changes!}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You now have a copy of both the current version of \texttt{bsa-computing} \textit{and} access to every previous version.
			\item This clone is NOT automatically synced, \`a la Dropbox
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Anything you break is completely isolated from the pristine copy on GitHub and your previous ``commits''.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Exercise:} Add to \texttt{food-exercise.md}, and save your changes.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Making Commits and Pushing}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Once you've accomplished a relatively small, but still significant task, you'll want to ``commit'' your code to the repository.
			\item This creates a labeled snapshot of the directory at the time of the commit.
			\item Syncing your commits with the existing remote repository is called ``pushing''.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Shell Commands for Commits and Push/Pull}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item To \textit{pull} down the most recent version of the remote repository, use \texttt{git pull}
			\item To make and push commits
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Check what you've changed with \texttt{git status} and \texttt{git diff}.
				\item Add files to the commit using \texttt{git add [files]}.
				\item Create a commit using \texttt{git commit -m [message]}
				\item Push your commit to the remote repository using \texttt{git push}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Merging Your Fork with the Original}
		On GitHub, create a \textit{pull request} to merge your changes into my repository. The owner (me) will be able to look at and accept/decline them.
	\end{frame}
	
	\section{\texttt{knitr}}
	
	\begin{frame}{What is \texttt{knitr}?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{knitr} lets you embed code and output from R into \LaTeX, HTML, RMarkdown, etc. I'll be using \LaTeX.
			\item Might require a bit more thought with R code to get the correct output, but it's worth it.
		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Chunks}
		\texttt{knitr} separates R code from \LaTeX \ using structures called ``chunks''.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Chunk Options}
		When you define a chunk, you also can include a number of options that tell \texttt{knitr} how to interpret the R code inside. Some basic important options are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{echo (TRUE)}: Whether or not to include the R code itself in the document.
			\item \texttt{results}: How to display results. Default is in a \LaTeX \ \texttt{verbatim} environment.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{asis}: Write raw results into the document (e.g., with \texttt{xtable})
			\end{itemize}
			\item \texttt{include (TRUE)}: Whether to include the chunk output in the document. The code is still run. Useful for data steps.
			\item \texttt{cache (FALSE)}: Stashes the output of a chunk to avoid running it every time you compile.
		\end{itemize}
